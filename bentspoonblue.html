                <h2>Why Bending Spoons?</h2>
                <div class="textbox">
                <p>I see you've chosen the blue pill. So welcome to <strong>why you?</strong></p>
              <p> Because of the first thing you see on your website. Impossible? Maybe. I resonate deeply with the challenge and the philosophy that you hold dear. For the second tab on a company website to be regarding 'Values' is incredibly rare, and dislays a committment to creating a workplace full of deeply ambitious, curious, inclusive, and emphathetic people. Not to mention, the company culture of growth, impact, and doing what others might say can't be done.
                </p>
                <p>To then work in this kind of space as a (for now, junior) communications manager both seems like deeply challenging role- as in, one where I must keep up with the technical and product teams, about which I might not know much (yet)-, and a deeply rewarding one- as in, one where the results of my work are deeply visible both within the company culture and external to it. </p>
                <p>Communications is the glue of an organization. It manages the thematics, the motifs, the metaphors. As a writer, to help orchestrate the literatures of such an ambitious company would be both a test and display of my skills in world-buidling.</p>

                <h2>Liaison</h2>
                <div class="textbox">
                <p>I'm excited to liase between the idea and the people. To find the right words, the right medium, the right timing.</p>
                <p>I made this metaphor somewhere earlier in my application, but I liked making it so much I'm going to make it again. A good communications department can make an industrial farm sound like an animal shelter; a bad communications department can make an animal shelter sound like an industrial farm. </p><p>Imagine what a good communications department for an animal shelter can do.</p>
                <p>That's exactly the kind of work I hope to soon be doing for Bending Spoons.</p>

                <h2>Dynamism</h2>
                <div class="textbox">
                <p>The idea must be understood to be dynamic. The static thought may be groundbreaking but will not break ground without the right tools. </p>
                <p>I'm excited to find those tools; in fact, I'm excited to bring my whole toolbox. And I'm excited to add some tools to it over the next couple of years. Furthermore, I can't wait to engage with and understand the complexities of what Bending Spoons actually does behind the scenes of the products we foster. And it seems like you move quite fast- I'm a fast person, too. While less so physically, metaphorically I'll happily either sprint or run the marathon, depending on what needs to be done that day.</p>

                <h2>Metabolism</h2>
                <div class="textbox">
                <p>True listening skills lie in the reception of feedback. Communication doesn't only go one way- I'm excited to act as a vessel of metabolization between the energy we give and the energy we get.</p>
                <p>I work best in a collaborative environment, whether this is a collaboration I pursue between myself and my team, clients, stakeholders, or just a passer-by unlucky enough to be caught by myself seeking an opinion.</p>
                <p>Regardless, I truly am a people person. So while I'm looking for a job that focuses on my skillsets behind a screen, I need there to be some connection to the ground, to the people I am actively engaging with. While I look forward to solving the riddles that my colleagues and superiors at Bending Spoons will throw at me, I look forward to the challenges set by our audience just as much.</p>

                <h2>Architecture</h2>
                <div class="textbox">
                <p>Can an architect truly rest without seeing their designs move from the drafting paper to the building's foundation?</p>
                <p>I don't think so.</p>
                <p>I have a sense that things at Bending Spoons move quickly. And so does a communications strategy. In the climate we live in, things need to get done fast and put out fast to keep up with the demands of a public. So what does that mean for me?</p>
                <p>It means that as a Junior Communications Manager for Bending Spoons, my work won't stay on the drafting paper for long. It means my impact will show. It means hard work and intense gratification. And although a writer, I have the ambitions of an architect, and this is a promise that deeply, deeply excites me about this role. </p>
